# Priv_NF   
Adam Taras 2022
Work done under Donald G. Dansereau as part of the Robotic Imaging Group, The University of Sydney

This is a git repo for source code for the second half of my thesis, with an aim of quantifying the privacy of our proposed methods. 

### Requirements

- Python 3.9
- TODO


### Structure

The folders for this project are:
- NF: (Normalising Flows) contains an adaptation of the [UvA tutes](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial11/NF_image_modeling.html) for training and evaluating the fidelity of flow models. 
- hashes: an implementation of random circle and random line extrema
- optimization_attack: a least squares based optimization attack on the hashes
- tests: unittsts on base functionality
- data_manipulation: misc tools for transforming LSUN bedroom data into a consistent form


### Pre trained models
